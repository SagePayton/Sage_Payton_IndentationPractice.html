            <h1>A Quick Synopsis About Me</h1>
            <p>I am 24 years young looking to make my life a little better by acquiring much needed skills, for I believe the more competent somebody is, the higher the quality of their life. I enjoy being productive with my life more than anything. I write this blog in the hopes of convincing others that valuing self-determinism above all else will lead to the life of your dreams. But at the end, one must rely on their own thoughts and not take anybody's word as final. As such, while the meaning for this blog is clear to me, it will hold its own value to you. Enjoy. </p>
